# zd1211-firmware
So, this is a repo I used to install firmware for my USB 3com dongle on a archiso.  
It'll probably work on other distros too, so here's a tutorial (I haven't tested it):  
1. `git clone` it.
2. Copy all files that start in `zd1211_` from `lib/firmware` to `/usr/lib/firmware/zd1211`.  

For further info, look into `lib/firmware/README`.
